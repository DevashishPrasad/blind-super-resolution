# blind-super-resolution

This repository presents the comparision between three approaches

1. Enhanced Deep Residual Networks for Single Image Super-Resolution
2. Unsupervised Degradation Representation Learning for Blind Super-Resolution 
3. Transformer based encoder for  Unsupervised Degradation Representation Learning for Blind Super-Resolution

All three of them were trained in blind super resolution fashion on same datasets under similar hyper-parameters.
