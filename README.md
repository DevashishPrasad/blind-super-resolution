# blind-super-resolution

This repository presents the comparision between three approaches

1. Enhanced Deep Residual Networks for Single Image Super-Resolution (EDSR)
2. Unsupervised Degradation Representation Learning for Blind Super-Resolution (UDRL) 
3. Transformer based encoder for  Unsupervised Degradation Representation Learning for Blind Super-Resolution (UDRLTE)

All three of them were trained in blind super resolution fashion on same datasets under similar hyper-parameters.
